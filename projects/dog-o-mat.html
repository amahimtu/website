<h2>Dog-O-Mat.</h2>
<h3>Effective dog grooming can be messy and time-consuming, so let us take care of it for you.</h3><br>

<div><h3>Overview.</h3>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>The Product</b>:</span> Redesigned, responsive website with an online booking flow for Dog-O-Mat dog grooming service in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-mockup1.png" alt="Dog-O-Mat website mockup on iPhone and MacBook Pro" class="center"><figcaption>Redesigned Dog-O-Mat Home Page</figcaption></figure><br>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>The Problem</b>:</span> The current Dog-O-Mat website has a plethora of user experience issues and is unresponsive. Despite the business’ high ratings and rave reviews (or perhaps because of them), Dog-O-Mat’s website needs an improved user experience and an online booking functionality in order to stay competitive, acquire new clients, and keep its current client base happy.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>The Goal</b>:</span> Redesign Dog-O-Mat’s website to improve its UX and make it responsive, and design the checkout flow for an online booking feature.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>My Role</b>:</span> Sole UX designer redesigning the new Dog-O-Mat website with an online booking feature and checkout flow.
</p>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>Project Duration</b>:</span> May 2021—July 2021
</p>

<p>Note: This case study/redesign and I are not affiliated with Dog-O-Mat, which I am sure offers excellent services. This case study features my insights and redesigns on Dog-O-Mat’s website purely from a user experience perspective.</p>

</div><br>

<div><h3>UX Review of Dog-O-Mat in its Current State.</h3>
  <p>At the time of this writing, the Dog-O-Mat website has a host of UX issues. I conducted a UX review/analysis of the site to identify and grasp these problems. Writing this review provided important context for the case study going forward and gave me a solid understanding of some of the main user experience criteria on which to focus.</p><br>

</div><br>

<div><h3>Foundational User Experience Research: User Interviews.</h3>
    <p>I conducted five interviews with potential future users of Dog-O-Mat. Participants included University of Michigan students and alumni, and an Ann Arbor resident who had not studied at the university; i.e., all participants have lived in or currently live in Ann Arbor. Each participant is also a dog owner and has used professional dog grooming services at least once (in Ann Arbor or otherwise) but none has used Dog-O-Mat specifically. </p>
    <p>The following image summarizes users’ pain points about dog grooming services and/or their websites.</p><br>
    <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-user-interviews-pp.png" alt="Summary of pain points from user interviews" class="center"><figcaption>Summary of Pain Points from User Interviews</figcaption></figure>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Personas.</h3>
    <p>Based on the user interviews, I came up with two personas to represent the different types of users who would use a service like Dog-O-Mat, particularly its redesigned version. Since Ann Arbor is a college town, some students have dogs and have very little time to groom them. Sol Guerrero would be interested in using Dog-O-Mat (partly because my redesign offers a student discount on services).</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Ann Arbor is also a hub for businesses, including large corporations. Someone like Marcia Paul who lives in Ann Arbor with her family would utilize Dog-O-Mat. She is interested in supporting local small businesses, has money to spare, and is not particularly keen on grooming her bichon frise puppy—a difficult task indeed.</p><br>

<p>Both personas would like an easy-to-use, online booking function.</p> 

</div><br>

<div><h3>User Journey Map.</h3>
    <p>I created a journey map to outline the journey of a typical Dog-O-Mat site user like Sol Guerrero.</p><br>
    <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-user-journey-map.jpg" alt="Dog-O-Mat user journey map" class="center"><figcaption>Typical User Journey on the Dog-O-Mat website</figcaption></figure><br>
    <p>This helped me to empathize with my users by trying to understand their emotions while navigating through the site. Additionally, it allowed me to think of opportunities for Dog-O-Mat to make users’ experience easier, such as by having a clear call-to-action button and user-friendly date selection feature.</p>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Competitive Audit.</h3>
    <p>I conducted a competitive audit to scope out Dog-O-Mat’s competition, analyze areas where it could improve, as well as features, functionalities, and strategies on which the business could capitalize. I identified <span class="highlight">three main direct competitors in Ann Arbor: Camp Bow Wow, Petco Dog Grooming, and Quality Grooming</span>. All three competitors—like Dog-O-Mat—are highly-ranked businesses on Google reviews.</p>
    <p>While Quality Grooming is a local small business like Dog-O-Mat, Petco Dog Grooming is part of the sprawling Petco corporation, and Camp Bow Wow is a large chain. Moreover, Camp Bow Wow is more well-known for its daycare services than its grooming services (grooming is not listed on its most popular services on its website). Petco Dog Grooming and Camp Bow Wow have fully functioning, responsive websites that allow for online booking, while Quality Grooming has an outdated, unresponsive site with limited functionality and no online booking.</p><br>

</div><br>

<div><h3>Ideation: Crazy Eights.</h3>
    <p>To get the creative juices flowing, I performed the crazy eights exercise, producing eight ideas in eight minutes.</p><br>

    <figure><img id="dom-img1" src="../images/dom-crazy-eights.png" alt="Crazy Eights Ideation Exercise for Dog-O-Mat website" class="center"><figcaption>Crazy Eights</figcaption></figure>
    <br>

    <p>Through this exercise, I sketched out some key features to potentially use in the Dog-O-Mat website. For instance, in panel 2, I drew a student discount feature, which would be extremely useful for students in Ann Arbor looking to save money when having their dog groomed. In panel 3, I came up with the idea of purchasing ‘add-ons’ such as dog shampoo or tick collars when users are checking out (I would later change this to add-on services instead of products).</p>

</div><br>

<div><h3>Information Architecture: Initial Sitemap.</h3> 
    <p>In order to craft the sitemap for Dog-O-Mat, I examined the information architecture of various dog grooming services that offer online booking, including Dog-O-Mat’s competitors from the competitive audit I conducted. Additionally, I tried out websites of similar businesses that allow users to book services online, such as barbers and hair salons. After drawing on some ideas and mixing in elements from Dog-O-Mat's existing information architecture, I came up with this initial sitemap:</p><br>
    <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-initial-sitemap.png" alt="Initial Sitemap for Dog-O-Mat" class="center"><figcaption>Initial Sitemap for Dog-O-Mat</figcaption></figure>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Wireframes.</h3>
    <p>With a sitemap in hand, I felt ready to begin wireframing. First, I created paper wireframes for the home page. I decided to have a hero image slider at the top of the page advertising Dog-O-Mat’s handiwork and services. I also thought the home page should feature a small ‘about us’ section as well as clear contact information. Most importantly, I drew a <span class="highlight">large call-to-action (CTA) button ("Book Now") on the homepage</span> for users to book a service—after all, this is the primary reason for them to visit the website. Further, I added a “testimonials” section to give Dog-O-Mat a warm, local small business touch.</p><br>

    </a>
</div>
<p id="caption-like1">Paper Wireframes for Dog-O-Mat</p><br>

<p>I then converted these paper wireframes to digital form (with the desktop home page ending up being a combination of the first and second versions I drew in my paper wireframes). Each page has the same header and footer since the header contains the Dog-O-Mat logo (which quickly redirects users to the home page when it is clicked), while the footer has contact information and social media links for users to refer to at any time during their visit to the website.
<p>I also crafted digital wireframes for the checkout process in the desktop view, which was tedious and required many iterations, as one tends to forget small details here and there.</p><br>

<figure><img src="../images/dom-digital-wireframes.png" alt="Dog-O-Mat digital wireframes" class="center"><figcaption>Digital Wireframes for Dog-O-Mat</figcaption></figure><br>

<p>While I’ve been through the checkout process umpteen times as a user, it is not easy to design a seamless checkout process as a designer. However, after several iterations, I created a four-step checkout process (enter info, select service, payment, and review).</p><br>

<figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-initial-4step-checkout.png" alt="Initial four-step checkout process for Dog-O-Mat" class="center"><figcaption>Initial Four-Step Checkout Process for Dog-O-Mat</figcaption></figure>

</div><br>

<div><h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype.</h3>
    <p>Using my digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. This was a <span class="highlight">particularly important step in the project as it shaped the “flow” part of the checkout flow</span>. Users need to be able to check out easily and quickly, and go back and forth between different pages without hassle (in case they need to change information or view other services, for instance). The pathways account for these possible actions.</p><br>
    <figure><img src="../images/dom-lofi-prototype.png" alt="Low-fidelity prototype pathways for Dog-O-Mat" class="center"><figcaption>Low-fidelity Prototype Pathways for Dog-O-Mat</figcaption></figure><br>
    <p>This low-fidelity prototype served as the basis for the usability test that I would conduct.</p>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Usability Testing & Results.</h3>
    <p>I decided to conduct a usability test on the low-fidelity prototype, and managed to re-recruit the five users who I interviewed at the start of this project. I chose to conduct the usability test at this stage—i.e., before moving onto high-fidelity prototyping—because I needed user feedback on the most important aspect of the design: the checkout flow.</p>
    <p>Key Parameters:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight"><b>Study Type</span>:</b> Unmoderated Usability Test</li>
    <li><span class="highlight"><b>Location:</span></b> United States; remote</li>
    <li><span class="highlight"><b>Participants:</span></b> 5</li>
    <li><span class="highlight"><b>Length:</span></b> ~30 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <figure><img src="../images/dom-ut-insights.png" id="dom-img" alt="Insights from usability test" class="center"><figcaption>Key Insights from Dog-O-Mat Usability Test</figcaption></figure><br>

    <p>Key Insights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight"><b>Confusing Two-Column Form</b>:</span> Initially, I created an “Enter Information” form that consisted of two-columns. Users were meant to enter their own information first, followed by their dog’s information. However, it was clear from the usability test that most users found this confusing and unintuitive.</li>
        <figure><img src="../images/dom-two-column.png" id="dom-img2" alt="Initial two-column information form for Dog-O-Mat" class="center"><figcaption>Initial Two-Column Form</figcaption></figure><br>
        <li><span class="highlight"><b>"Select Service" Before "Enter Information"</b>:</span> Users preferred the ability to select a service before entering their information. This way, they could feel assured of the service they were selecting before committing to Dog-O-Mat.</li>
        <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-initial-4step-checkout2.png" alt="Initial four-step checkout process for Dog-O-Mat" class="center"><figcaption>"Select Service" Step Should Occur Before "Enter Info"</figcaption></figure><br>
        <li><span class="highlight"><b>Shopping Cart is a Must-Have Feature</b>:</span> Initially, I felt I could do away with the cart so that users could directly book a service. However, users asked why they could not look at their shopping cart before checking out. An online shopping cart on websites is so common that users felt almost out of place or uncomfortable without it. Also, considering that the redesigned site will offer add-on services and <a href="">allow signed-in users to book multiple services at a time</a>, a cart feature is necessary for users to add or remove services with ease.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--<p>Other User Insights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul><br>-->
</div><br>

<div><h3>Changes to Information Architecture.</h3>
    <p>I identified several changes to make to the sitemap, based on user feedback from the usability test as well as my own discretion and design philosophy for the site:</p><br>
    <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-initial-sitemap2.png" alt="Initial Sitemap for Dog-O-Mat with annotations for changes made" class="center"><figcaption>Initial Sitemap for Dog-O-Mat with annotations for Changes to be Made</figcaption></figure><br>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="highlight">“Do-It-Yourself” should not be a standalone page</span>. Instead, it can be included in “Services.” No more than three main pages in the navigation bar (home, services, and about) would ensure the website is clean and easy to navigate.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">The “shop” feature (i.e., shopping for accessories) is unnecessary</span>. Since Dog-O-Mat sells items in-store, most people would rather buy these items at or after their dog’s appointment, or utilize stores like Chewy. Additionally, implementing e-commerce functionality within Dog-O-Mat would take a lot of additional back-end development resources. Instead, the focus of the site should be on booking a grooming service.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">“Cart” should be included along with log-in and sign up buttons</span> on the top right of the page, as is customary with most online retailers and services.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">The “Sign In/Checkout as Guest/Sign Up” process should occur earlier in the service booking flow</span>, rather than impeding the user when they have almost completed their transaction.</li>
    </ol>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Revised Sitemap.</h3>
    <p>After the results of the usability test (as well as going through the prototype myself a couple of times), I felt the need to revise the sitemap.</p><br>

    <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap for Dog-O-Mat website" class="center"><figcaption>Revised Sitemap for Dog-O-Mat Website</figcaption></figure><br>
    
    <p>The main change in the checkout flow is that <span class="highlight">users must be able to select a service before entering their dog’s (and their own) information</span>, and then proceeding with the checkout process. That way, they are assured of the service they are selecting before submitting their information and/or committing to the checkout process.</p> 
    <p>In the top right corner, the <span class="highlight">log in, sign up, and cart buttons accompany each other</span>, as is customary in many online service booking sites and ecommerce applications. Users can easily see the number of items in their cart and/or login or sign up at any time.</p> 
    <p>Additionally, I cut down on the <span class="highlight">number of pages visible in the nav bar to three—home, about, and contact</span>—for a clean look and so that users can focus on booking a service or contacting Dog-O-Mat to do so. The current version of Dog-O-Mat does not have an about page; I felt it essential to add this, especially so that Dog-O-Mat can make it known that they are a proud local small business in Ann Arbor.</p>
    <p>This new sitemap is considerably cleaner and less convoluted than the earlier version, which makes for an enhanced user experience.</p>

</div><br>

<div><h3>Key Mockups.</h3>
    <b>Mobile Mockups:</b>
    <p>I created mobile mockups for some key pages within the Dog-O-Mat site, including the home page and the services page.</p><br>

    <b>Desktop Mockups:</b>
    <p>In addition to the home page and services page, the desktop mockups include the complete checkout flow.</p><br>

</div><br>

<div><h3>Checkout Flow.</h3>
    <p>I designed the user flow for the <span class="highlight">new four-step checkout process (enter info, select date, make payment, and review)</span> after users select a service. The checkout flow will be demonstrated in the <a href="#dom-vid">video prototype</a> as well.</p><br>

    <figure><img id="dom-img" src="../images/dom-prototype-pathways.png" alt="Dog-O-Mat prototype pathways" class="center"><figcaption>Dog-O-Mat Prototype Pathways</figcaption></figure><br>

    <p>Have a look at the video demonstration of the Dog-O-Mat prototype:</p><br>
    <div id="dom-vid"><video class="center" controls muted>
        <source src="../images/dom-screen-recording.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Sorry, your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video></div><br>

    <p>The individual checking out is a student at the University of Michigan named Sol Guerrero, who is looking to groom his Rottweiler. In the prototype, you may notice that the site automatically changes the price of his selected service according to Sol’s dog’s weight (larger dogs or certain breeds are more expensive to groom).</p>
    <p>Additionally, after he enters his student email ID, he is able to avail of a 15% discount (but must present his ID when he visits Dog-O-Mat).</p>

    <hr><div id="dom-notes"><p><u>Note:</u> The redesigned site allows ‘guest’ users to book one service (along with unlimited add-ons) at a time, as shown in the mockups and prototype. This is so that there is no confusion when they are selecting a date for each service and/or if any additional services they are booking is for another dog (who will have different information, breed, weight, and so on, which will need to be re-entered).</p>
    <p>However, if users are signed in (i.e., if they have an account), they would be able to save their pets’ information on the site and thus can book multiple services at a time. Accordingly, the UX (and information architecture) of the checkout flow will differ slightly, allowing signed-in users to access their saved dog profiles as well as book multiple services at a time. This feature would not only be pragmatic from a web development perspective but may also incentivize Dog-O-Mat customers to create accounts, potentially increasing customer loyalty.</p></div><hr>

<div><h3>Reflection & Takeaways.</h3>
    <p>With additional time and resources at my disposal, I would:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design the checkout flow UX for signed-in users (<a href="#dom-notes" id="dom-note-link">see note</a>)</li>
        <li>Design the checkout flow for other device sizes, like I did for the desktop prototype</li>
        <li>Conduct additional usability tests to resolve pending issues, if any</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a lover of both dogs and the city of Ann Arbor (home to my undergraduate alma mater, the University of Michigan), this project is dear to me. While I have never been to Dog-O-Mat, I feel that its website could benefit from the user experience enhancements I covered in this redesign case study.</p>
    <p>Thank you for checking out this project. I welcome <a href="../contact.html">feedback!</a></p>
