<h2><span id="dr">Find My Art School.</span></h2>
<h3><span id="dr">The</span> world needs artists & designers now more than ever. <span id="dr">Find</span> the right art school.</h3><br>

<div><h3>Overview.</h3>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>The Product</b>:</span> <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> is an app that provides valuable resources and information to art school applicants (the app’s primary users) to help them find the right college and/or program. Art and technology are no longer mutually exclusive, which is why the app has a strong emphasis on <span id="pi">STEAM</span>. <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> allows users to browse and learn about art-focused colleges and programs, read curated blog articles to keep up with the latest ongoings in the art school world, utilize portfolio resources, find and connect with mentors, and take courses via a partnership with <span id="dr">Kadenze</span>, a creative technology education platform.</p>

<div><figure><img src="../images/fmas-main-mockup.png" alt="Find My Art School mockup on iPhone" class="center" id="fmas-main-mockup"></figure></div>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>The Problem</b>:</span> Universities and colleges offer a plethora of art programs and courses for students, while conventional college finder/ranking sites do not provide enough information about specialized art programs and schools.</p>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>The Goal</b>:</span> Design an app that is a one-stop shop for prospective art school applicants to find out about the right program for them, and so that they can leverage resources to strengthen their applications and skillsets.</p>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>My Role</b>:</span> UX/UI Designer and Researcher designing the <span id="dr">Finding My Art School</span> app from conception to <a href="#fmas-high-fidelity-prototype">prototype</a>.</p>

<p><span class="highlight"><b>Project Duration</b>:</span> March 2021—May 2021</p>


</div><br>

<div><h3>Foundational User Experience Research (UXR)</h3></div>
<p>I conducted five interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I designed for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was students/young adults interested in applying to art school but unsure of programs and schools to which to apply.</p>
<p>Users cited the plethora of programs offered by art colleges and universities today but the <span class="highlight">lack of specific resources for students to get in-depth insights about art schools</span>, and a sense of difficulty making informed decisions about applying to them.</p><br>
<figure><img src="../images/fmas-uxr-pain-points.png" alt="User Pain Points" class="center" id="fmas-uxr"><figcaption>User Pain Points from User Experience Research</figcaption></figure>

</div></br>


<div><h3>User Personas.</h3>

<p>Based on the foundational UX research, I developed three personas to represent different groups of users: <span id="dr">RJ Lee, Bill Forrest</span>, and <span id="dr">Ece Akkan</span>. While each of their journeys is unique, they have one thing in common: each of them wants to find the best art school and/or program for them—one that is the right fit.</p>

<p id="caption-like1">User Personas: <span id="dr">RJ Lee, Bill Forrest, Ece Akkan</span></p><br>

<div><h3>User Journey Map.</h3>
<p>I created a user journey map to outline a path depicting how a typical user might use <span id="dr">Find My Art School.</span></p>
<figure><img id="fmas-user-journey-map" src="../images/fmas-user-journey-map.png" alt="Find My Art School User Journey Map" class="center"><figcaption>User Journey Map</figcaption></figure>
<p>Crafting this map was helpful for me to put myself in the user’s shoes by trying to understand their emotions while using Find My Art School and in what order they would potentially navigate through the app’s features. Hopefully, developing this additional empathy through the journey mapping process also served to reduce the impact of any designer bias I might have unknowingly had.</p>
</div><br>


<div><h3>Competitive Audit.</h3>
<p>Having successfully entered the ‘ideate’ phase, I conducted a competitive audit to identify who <span id="dr">Find My Art School’s</span> competitors might be, what is working for them and what isn’t. I identified <span class="highlight">three competitors: <span id="dr">Niche, Kadenze, & US News Best Colleges.</span></span> None of these services, however, offer quite what <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> does. While <span id="dr">Niche</span> is the only ‘direct’ competitor (even then, somewhat loosely so), it has a much broader target audience, which includes college applicants to all kinds of disciplines—not just art schools. Additionally, <span id="dr">Niche</span> includes information on only <span id="pi">US</span> colleges, whereas <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> has an international scope. <span id="dr">Kadenze</span>, like <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span>, emphasizes <span id="pi">STEAM</span> but is a MOOC/creative education platform; <span id="dr">US News Best Colleges</span> focuses mainly on college rankings.</p>

<p>Both <span id="dr">US News Best Colleges</span> and <span id="dr">Niche</span> club art schools into more general categories (for example, fine arts and contemporary art programs are often put into the same category), unlike <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span>, which helps users get a more detailed look at art colleges to find the right program, even the more ‘niche’ (no pun intended) ones.</p>

<div><h3>Ideation: Crazy Eights.</h3>
<p>In order to quickly come up with a host of ideas for <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span>, I performed the “Crazy Eights” ideation exercise, producing <span class="highlight">eight ideas in eight minutes.</span></p>
<figure><img id="fmas-crazy-eights" src="../images/fmas-crazy-eights.jpeg" alt="Crazy Eights ideation exercise for Find My Art School app" class="center"><figcaption>Crazy Eights</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>While some ideas were based on things I thought of earlier, some were spontaneously cooked up during the exercise; for instance, while I thought of integrating some kind of virtual reality experience in the app at an earlier stage, the idea to include a “learn” feature occurred to me during the exercise itself. In either case, I found it useful to actually draw out these ideas as I started to get a better sense of how I could begin to flesh out the app.</p>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Storyboarding.</h3>
<p>To further empathize with my potential users, I created a storyboard, choosing to put myself in <span id="dr">RJ Lee’s</span> shoes. <span id="dr">RJ</span>, who was previously conflicted, confused, and overwhelmed when it came to choosing and applying to art schools, takes advantage of the resources on the <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> app to boost his confidence and bolster his art school application.</p>
<figure><img id="fmas-storyboard" src="../images/fmas-storyboard.JPG" alt="Find My Art School: RJ's storyboard" class="center"><figcaption>Storyboard</figcaption></figure><br>

<p><b>Panel 1:</b> <span id="rj">RJ</span> wants to apply to art schools but is confused/overwhelmed by all the information online. </p>
<p><b>Panel 2:</b> He finds and downloads the <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> app.</p>
<p><b>Panel 3:</b> After quickly signing up, he takes a brief tutorial on all the app’s features.</p>
<p><b>Panel 4:</b> <span id="rj">RJ</span> searches and browses programs/colleges with the help of filters.</p>
<p><b>Panel 5:</b> <span id="rj">RJ</span> avails of resources on the app and finds and connects with a mentor.</p>
<p><b>Panel 6:</b> By leveraging the resources on <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span>, <span id="rj">RJ</span> is now feeling confident and will soon be ready to apply!</p><br>

</div><br>

<div>
<h3>Information Architecture: Sitemap.</h3>
<p>I created a sitemap to help organize and clarify the content for the site, given much thought as to the menus and navigation that would allow users to have an exploratory experience. I categorized the app’s pages into four main categories: <span class="highlight">home, browse, resources, and learn.</span></p>
<p>Note that this sitemap displays the information architecture of the app after the user signs up/logs in; i.e., the sign up/log-in process is not shown here.</p>
<figure><img id="fmas-sitemap" src="../images/fmas-sitemap.png" alt="Find My Art School app sitemap" class="center"><figcaption>Sitemap</figcaption></figure><br>
<p>With a clear, detailed sitemap in hand, I began to visualize the wireframes for <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span>.</p>
</div>
<br>


<div>
<h3>Wireframes.</h3>
<p>I sketched out some paper wireframes using a pen and paper as shown below. This allowed me to quickly draw out the skeleton of the app, without spending too much time on details.</p>

<p id="caption-like">Paper wireframes for <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> (12 screens)</p><br>

<p>Using my paper wireframes as a reference, I drew up a set of digital wireframes that I could use as the basis for the <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> prototype. I made some modifications to the original (paper) wireframes; for example, the sign up/login pages are simple and more fleshed out, and the settings page is its own frame rather than an overlay.</p>

<figure><img id="fmas-digital-wireframes" src="../images/fmas-digital-wireframes.png" alt="Find My Art School digital wireframes" class="center"><figcaption>Early Digital Wireframes</figcaption></figure></div>
<br>

<div><h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype.</h3>
<p>I created a low-fidelity prototype, marking out the pathways, navigation, and interaction available to users. The <span class="highlight">app experience is meant to be exploratory rather than linear</span>, and this is reflected by the flexibility of the “back and forth” style pathways featured in this lo-fi prototype.

</div>-->

<div>
<h3>User Experience Research (UXR) and Usability Testing.</h3>

<p>With a lo-fi prototype in hand, it was now time to dive into research and conduct a usability test. I wanted to see how real users experienced the app, albeit in low-fidelity form.</p>

<p>Key Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>Study Type</span>:</b> Moderated Usability Study/Concept Test</li>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>Location:</span></b> United States and India; remote</li>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>Participants:</span></b> 5</li>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>Length:</span></b> ~30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram below summarizes my process.</p>

<figure><img id="fmas-uxr" src="../images/fmas-uxr.png" alt="Diagram explaing user experience research and usability testing process" class="center"><figcaption>User Experience Research & Concept Testing Process</figcaption></figure><br>

<p>During the moderated usability study, I took detailed notes and observed users’ behaviour. I then created an affinity diagram with useful insights from users in the form of quotes.</p>

<figure><img id="fmas-affinity-diagram" src="../images/fmas-affinity-diagram.png" alt="Affinity diagram against snowy Michigan photograph, based on Find My Art School user research insights" class="center"><figcaption>Affinity Diagram Based on User Research Insights <br> (Background Image Taken by Me at the University of Michigan School of Music Fountain)</figcaption></figure>

</div>
<br>

<div>
<h3>Revised Wireframes and User Flow After Concept Testing.</h3>

<p>After conducting the usability tests and synthesizing research insights, I made <span class="highlight">three key changes</span> to the wireframes and user flow of the app:</p><br>


<figure><img id="fmas-revised-wireframes" src="../images/fmas-revised-wireframes.png" alt="Diagram depicting revised wireframes and user flow based on insights from usability testing" class="center"><figcaption>Revised Wireframes and User Flow Based on Actionable Insights from Usability Testing</figcaption></figure>

<ol>
<li><span class="highlight"><b>User Onboarding Part 1: Onboarding Screens.</b></span><br>
<p>I created four onboarding screens to show users what they can do on the app. The onboarding screens will appear before the sign-up process so users don’t have to ‘commit’ before beginning to use <span id="dr">Find My Art School</span>.</p></li>

<li><span class="highlight"><b>User Onboarding Part 2: Onboarding Questions.</b></span><br>
<p>I created three questions (one per screen) to learn about users, including their preferred location, degree choices, and their areas of interest. Subsequently, the app would tailor content based on user preferences.</p></li>

<li><span class="highlight"><b>Search via Map.</b></span><br>
<p>Users can search for colleges on a map, providing a fun, interactive way for users to engage with the app, as well as learn more about the schools they are interested in and their surrounding areas and neighborhoods.</p></li>

</ol>
</div><br>

<div><h3>Mockups.</h3>
<p>Armed with revised wireframes and a modified low-fidelity prototype, I created a logo and mockups of the app’s screens. Shortly after deciding on a color scheme, however, I realized that the contrast between the app’s text and background was not high enough and quickly rectified this in order to create designs that are more visible to a wider range of users.</p>
<figure><img id="fmas-mockup-contrast-check" src="../images/fmas-mockup-contrast-check.png" alt="Diagram depicting an app mockup screen before and after contrast checking" class="center"><br><figcaption>For greater accessibility, I changed the color palette of the app after contrast checking. In the image on the right, the text stands out more.
</figcaption></figure><br>
<p>I then created the mockups for the rest of the app. Some <span class="highlight">key mockups</span> are featured below:</p>

<div><h3>Reflection & Takeaways.</h3>
<p><span id="dr">Find My Art School</span> has been both a challenging and rewarding project. Through practicing the <span class="highlight">design thinking</span> methodology, I sharpened my UX design skills and learned how to empathize with users. I observed firsthand how well-planned user research and testing resulted in successful iterations and improved designs. Additionally, by creating features like an interactive map and integrating a VR-like experience into the app, I’ve been able to take my design skills to the next level. I’m eager to apply my newfound knowledge to my next UX case study.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking out this project. I welcome <a href="../contact.html">feedback!</a></p>
